Please keep in mind that not everything in this website is directly used in MIS-3371, but, if you have the time, this will help you understand how the front-end of a website is built.  

### My guides:  

[HTML, CSS and JavaScript  What are they?](html-css-js.md)  
Basic HTML page: [hello.html](hello.html)  

[Website file structure guidelines](structure.md)  
[How to access files](accessing-files.md)  

[HTML things worth learning!](learn-html/)  
[CSS things worth learning!](learn-css/)  
[JavaScript things worth learning!](learn-js/)  

[Essential knowledge for this class](essential.md) _(coming soon!)_  
In the meantime, just look at everything html/css/js related on the syllabus.  
Don't forget to do the practice exams!
